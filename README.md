## Welcome!

The Xbox Live Trace Analyzer tool ensures your title is using Xbox Live Services in an optimal fashion. Generate usage logs for your title as described in the Analyze Calls to Xbox Live Services article, and then run this tool to view statistics about repeated calls, burst calls, and more. When your title uses Xbox Live Services properly, you will mitigate the risk of being throttled, reduce the chance of unexpected behavior, and improve the performance of your title.

## Usage
